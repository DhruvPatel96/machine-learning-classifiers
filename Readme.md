I have implemented various machine learning algorithms using popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

In this repository, I have used different datasets like moons1, circles0.3, halfkernel, spiral1, twogaussians33, twogaussians42, and Breastcancer dataset to train and test the models.

I have used various classifiers like DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, MLPClassifier, and ensemble methods to make predictions on the given datasets.

For data pre-processing and manipulation, I have used Pandas and NumPy libraries. The scikit-learn's model_selection module is used for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

To evaluate the performance of the models, I have used metrics like confusion_matrix and accuracy_score from the sklearn.metrics library.

Overall, this repository can be a great resource for anyone who wants to learn and implement machine learning algorithms using popular libraries in Python.
